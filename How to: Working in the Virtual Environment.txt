What to do:

Every time you want to work on this project in a new terminal session (whether it's after a reboot, closing and reopening VS Code, or just opening a new terminal tab):

Open your terminal (like the integrated terminal in VS Code).

Navigate to your project directory (youtube-processor). Use cd if needed.
cd /path/to/your/youtube-processor

Activate the environment:
source venv/bin/activate

Check for the (venv) prefix in your prompt to confirm it's active before running any python or pip commands for this project.
VS Code Note: Sometimes, if you have the Python interpreter for the project correctly set within VS Code (pointing to the one inside venv), VS Code's integrated terminal might automatically activate the environment for you when you open a new terminal panel. However, it's always best practice to glance at the prompt and make sure (venv) is there before you start working. If it's missing, just run the source venv/bin/activate command.
